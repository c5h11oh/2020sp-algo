# Algorithms Spring 2020 Homework

## Overview
This repository contains all the (home)works done in the "Computer Algorithms" course offered at [National Taiwan Normal University ](https://www.ntnu.edu.tw/)(NTNU) by [Professor Mei-Chen Yeh (葉梅珍教授)](http://www2.csie.ntnu.edu.tw/~myeh/) in Spring 2020. Each piece of homework consists of a handwritten problem set which usually includes three problems (sometimes two), and two programming problems, pA and pB.

## Course (and therefore Homework) Coverage
We used Cormen's *Introduction to Algorithms* (3rd ed.) as the principal learning material. We went through the following contents:
1. Asymptotic notation; Recurrences
2. Randomized algorithms; Divide-and-Conquer
3. Sorting: Heapsort, quicksort, linear sorting
4. Hashing and binary search
5. Dynamic programming
6. Greedy algorithms
7. Graph algorithms
8. Shortest paths
9. Maximum flow
10. NP-completeness
11. Approximate algorithms

The following section describes each homework's main topic and provides the link to the corresponding homework set (in PDF).
